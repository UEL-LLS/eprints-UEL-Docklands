eprints-UEL-Docklands
=====================

Docklands Themes package was create by the University of East London as a way to brand both ROAR and DATA.uel in a similar but identifiably different way. 

Docklands Themes allows non css experts to customise the look and feel of their repository. It uses the Bootstrap system to makes your repository responsive (for mobile browsers). 

Further guidelines will be created to allow new compatible themes to be created. 
This designed to compliment the existing EPrints theme architecture. 

This package also works with my Cookies package allowing you to theme the cookies warning.
